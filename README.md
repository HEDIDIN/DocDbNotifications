# Notifications for new or modified DocumentDB Resources

This article came about from a question I once saw posted.  The question was “Does DocumentDB support notifications for modified resources?” 

I have worked with BizTalk Server for many years, and this is a very common scenario when using the [WCF LOB Adapter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb798128.aspx) .  So I decided to see if I could duplicate this functionality in DocumentDB for new and/ or modified documents.
